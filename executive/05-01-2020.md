# [Executive Vote] Lower USDC SF, Add WBTC, Ratify the Initial MIPs and Subproposals

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Add WBTC as a Collateral Type](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnjrmznpnc9vczzdbuhhua4r3e1gtee5r1ar2yrjhyb82)
- [Lower the USDC Stability Fee from 6% to 0%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmc9jj1dyycrmft3pe1yyq6zzz8xdjxzw1gxqzkaogiawe)
- [Officially ratify the initial 13 MIPs and 2 Subproposals](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmyqqe9guqfld2ge9rskly9jxycctgua8j6kevf5dhlnta)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

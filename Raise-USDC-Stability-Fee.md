# [Executive Vote] Raise USDC Stability Fee

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Raise the USDC Stability Fee from 0% to 1%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmfhclbxzjypk4aatyvwqthtuqr5842xnrytj8q89ajb6z)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
